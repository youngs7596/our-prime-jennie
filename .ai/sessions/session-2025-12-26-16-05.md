# Session Handoff: Execution Services Tests Complete

## 요약 (Summary)
Phase 10: Execution Service Tests have been successfully implemented and verified. `buy-executor`, `sell-executor`, and `scheduler-service` now all exceed the 50% test coverage goal. Critical fixes were applied to `sell-executor` tests (duplicate order logic) and `scheduler-service` tests (timezone handling, dependencies).

## 변경 사항 (Changes)
- `tests/services/buy-executor/test_buy_executor.py`: Verified existing tests passing.
- `tests/services/sell-executor/test_sell_executor.py`: Patched `check_duplicate_order` to prevent false positives in tests. Verified 77% coverage.
- `tests/services/scheduler-service/test_scheduler.py`: Created new comprehensive test suite. Verified 69% coverage.
- `services/scheduler-service/requirements.txt`: Installed dependencies (`APScheduler`, `sqlalchemy`, etc.).
- `task.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, `walkthrough.md`: Updated to reflect Phase 10 completion.

## 다음 단계 (Next Steps)
- Implement Phase 11: Deployment & Integration Tests (if applicable).
- Review overall project coverage and address any remaining low-coverage areas.
